# Data Clumps
## Definition
In object-oriented programming, "data clump" is a name given to any group of variables which are passed around together (in a clump) throughout various parts of the program. A data clump, like other code smells, can indicate deeper problems with the program design or implementation. The group of variables that typically make up a data clump are often closely related or interdependent and are often used together in a group as a result. A data clump is also known as a specific kind of class-level code smell that may be a symptom of poorly written source code.
